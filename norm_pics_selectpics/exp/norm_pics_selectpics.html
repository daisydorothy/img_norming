    <p id="instruct-text"> In this task, you will see illustrated images of different people. <br>
      You will read an adjective or short description, and you should click on every person that you think the description applies to.

       At the end, you will then be asked a few brief questions about yourself. The task will take around 2.5 minutes. <br>
       <br>
       You must be a native speaker of US English to take this HIT.

  <p> In this task, you will see an image of a person. <br>
    You should give three adjectives that first come to mind when you see the person.
    <br>
    <br>
  <img src="training.jpg" alt="user" id="userpic"></img>
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, you might describe the person above as 'kind', 'frail', and 'hardworking'.
  <br>
  You can use whatever adjectives you like, but try not to focus just on physical attributes, or what the person is wearing.
  <br>
  <br>
  You will then be asked a few additional questions about your impressions of the person.

# Norming experiments for images used as stimuli in Style in Time dissertation work

* Two experiments:
  * `norm_pics_freechoice` : participants saw a single image, supplied three adjectives to describe image, answered questions re perceived location, occupation (etc.) of person in image. Designed to elicit semiotic associations of two different sets of personas - the Toughs and Valleys. 
  * `norm_pics_selectpics`: participants saw a set of images, and an adjective (e.g. *Click on all the people who look **feminine***). Designed to establish best exemplars of Tough and Valleyness.

* Within each subdir, 
  * `analysis` = analysis code (R) for experimental data
  * `exp` = experimental code (Javascript/HTML) for running experiment with MTurk participants
  * participant data is omitted from the repos
